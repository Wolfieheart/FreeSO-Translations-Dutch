# FreeSO Translation Project - Dutch (NL/BE)
Welcome to the Dutch Translation Project for The Sims Online / FreeSO.

This repo is maintained by W0lfstorm. You can see my progress for this project here and on [The FreeSO Forums](http://forum.freeso.org/threads/wip-dutch-translations-v0-1.6494/#post-31765)

## Project Outine

As I outlined over on the FreeSO Forums, this project will be split into 2 parts:

1. UI Texts from FreeSO (ETA: October 5th 2019)  
> This is what I am currently working on. There are 25 files to be translated, of which all have 10+ strings of text. These are the things that the user will see and interact with almost everyday, so the language in this will need to be correct. 


2. UT Texts from The Sims Online [Base Game Items] (ETA: Before End of November 2019)  
> This will be Phase 2 of the translation. As part of the FreeSO experience, players are required to get The Sims Online. Therefore all of these strings will also require translation.

3. Objects  
> This is Phase 3 and will be completed... I am planning to do this once the new Object System (.piff -> .cst) are implemented

## Contributing
You can contribute by helping me correct any/all Dutch that sounds out of place. 

**Reminder: I am from Ireland and Dutch is my 2nd Language, so there may be a few words out of place.   
Please Note: The Majority of the translations have been checked against the Dutch for Flanders/Belgium, with a native speaker**

If you find anything that is incorrect, please create an issue or a Pull Request.
