# FreeSO Translation Project - Nederland/Belgie
Welcome to the Dutch Translation Project for The Sims Online / FreeSO.

This repo is maintained by W0lfstorm. You can see my progress for this project here and on [The FreeSO Forums](http://forum.freeso.org/threads/wip-dutch-translations-v0-1.6494/#post-31765)

## Project Outine

As I outlined over on the FreeSO Forums, this project will be split into 2 parts:

1. UI Texts from The Sims Online/FreeSO  
This is what I am currently working on. There are 25 files to be translated, of which all have 10+ strings of text. These are the things that the user will see and interact with almost everyday, so the language in this will need to be correct. 

2. Objects

## Contributing
You can contribute by helping me correct any/all Dutch that sounds out of place. 

**Reminder: I am from Ireland and Dutch is my 2nd Language, so there may be a few words out of place.   
Please Note: The Majority of the translations have been checked against the Dutch for Flanders/Belgium, with a native speaker**

If you find anything that is incorrect, please create an issue or a Pull Request.
